## Project Overview

The **Installation of a 50kVA, 11/0.415kV Distribution Transformer** at **Al-Yaqeen Academy, Kaduna** was executed to provide the school with a **stable, efficient, and dedicated power supply** for its classrooms, laboratories, and administrative blocks.  

Prior to the installation, the academy relied on an unreliable shared connection that frequently interrupted learning activities.  
This project provided a **standalone power solution** directly tied to the 11kV network to enhance operational reliability and energy efficiency.
